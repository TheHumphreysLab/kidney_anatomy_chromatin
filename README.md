# Chromatin interaction and histone modification profiles across the human kidney anatomy
This repository documents scripts that generate figures related to our manuscript in which we performed chromatin interaction (Hi-C) and modification profiling (CUT&RUN for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) across human kidney anatomic regions.

The work is published on Scientific Data in 2024.<br>
